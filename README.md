# ðŸš€ Sensor Fault Detection with Machine Learning! ðŸš€

In industrial and IoT systems, faulty sensor readings can lead to inaccurate decisions and system failures. To tackle this, I built a Sensor Fault Detection system using Machine Learning and integrated it with CI/CD for automated deployment.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features:<br>
âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values & outliers<br>
âœ… Feature Engineering â€“ Extracting meaningful insights from sensor data<br>
âœ… ML Model Training â€“ Detecting sensor faults efficiently<br>
âœ… CI/CD Integration â€“ Automating model deployment with GitHub Actions<br>
âœ… Performance Optimization â€“ Ensuring accuracy & robustness<br>
